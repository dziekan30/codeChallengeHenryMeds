So far i created basic navigation and stack navigator, some mockup of schedule for providers and as well for users to schedule an appointment. My next step would be creating a basic backend for user Auth and connecting to the database. From that I would start implementing more logic, adding functionality to ProvidersScreen would need to save the data in the backend, then I would use that data for scheduling on the client side.
I would need to add more logic to ScheduleAppointmentScreen so it would show exactly the schedule of each provider and add 24 hr advance booking. I would love to build a more complex app and share with you if you will give me a little bit more time.
Thank you, looking forward to your review.
