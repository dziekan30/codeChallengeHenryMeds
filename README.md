I just finished your coding challenge. Unfortunately I wasn't able to add all of the features because of the time limit. I put myself to the challenge of 2 hr coding as per request. 
If I had more time I would definitely add more features. 
I would start by building a basic backend in node.js, with user auth, then I would integrate that with the front end / mobile app. On the Mobile app I would  create a login page  where users can login as client or provider. Then from there I would fix the scheduling dashboard on the provider side and be unable to save data in the database. The next step would be fetching that data to the customer side, and providing them a schedule availability, and allow the user to book a time slot.
If you will agree to give me more time to work on those features that would be great. This way I could build a more complex app. Please let me know if this would be an option. If not Iâ€™m still proud of what I built in those 2 hrs.
